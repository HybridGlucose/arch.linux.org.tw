**原文：**[ The end of i686 support](https://www.archlinux.org/news/the-end-of-i686-support/)

<p>Following 9 months of <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/news/phasing-out-i686-support/">deprecation period</a>, support for the i686
architecture effectively ends today. By the end of November, i686
packages will be removed from our mirrors and later from the packages
archive. The [multilib] repository is not affected.</p>
<p>For users unable to upgrade their hardware to x86_64, an alternative is
a community maintained fork named <a href="https://archlinux32.org/">Arch Linux 32</a>. See their website
for details on migrating existing installations.</p>
